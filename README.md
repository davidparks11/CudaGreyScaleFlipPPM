# CudaGreyScaleFlipPPM
Basic CUDA program to set a picture to grey-scale and flip a PPM file (not optimized).

This is a school project assigned before memory optimization was taught, meaning this
program is incredibly inefficient. Only code between

"///Student Code(X1/XN)/// 
My work here
///End Student Code(X1/XN)///"

is my own work, otherwise, code was given by professor.
